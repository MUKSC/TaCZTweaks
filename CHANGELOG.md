- Implemented config sync between server and client
  - Server-side options are now synced to clients to prevent desync issues
  - Players with operator status can update the config on the server from GUI 
- Block interactions now fire the Forge block break event
  - This allows mods/plugins like WorldGuard to properly prevent blocks from breaking when necessary
- Fixed the `crawl.enabled` option being incorrectly located under the client config
- Fixed the bullet whizzing feature stopped working since 2.5.1
- Fixed some ghost block issues
